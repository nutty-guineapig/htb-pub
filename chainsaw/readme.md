Smart contract box, mainly use of web3 apis

1. Retrieve json and sol, and smart contract address over ftp
2. first_contract.py will connect and trigger command injection on the contract
3. ssh forward service to localhost
4. run second_contract.py to modify contract values
5. run the binary on the host, and login - since the new values were set in the contract
